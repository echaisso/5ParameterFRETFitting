This package was originally written using the Google Colab interpreter. If this is the case, you can download the .ipynb file and run it from the free Google Colab interpreter. **This is the suggested version**

If you would rather use your own interpreter, it will change some of the downloads that you need. If you want to use your own interpreter, use the .py notebook. 

For python: 
-numpy
-matplotlib
-scipy 
-ipywidgets
-ipython
-pandas
